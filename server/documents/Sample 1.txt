As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most [[client-server]] systems, Git maintains a local copy of the entire [[Repository (version control)|repository]], also known as the "repo", with history and version-tracking abilities, independent of [[Computer network|network]] access or a central [[Server (computing)|server]]. A repository is stored on each computer in a standard [[directory (computing)|directory]] with additional, [[Hidden file and hidden directory|hidden files]] to provide version control capabilities.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Chacon |first1 = Scott |title = Pro Git |date = 24 December 2014 |publisher = [[Apress]] |location = New York, NY |isbn = 978-1-4842-0077-3 |pages = 29-30 |edition = 2nd |url = https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225223054/http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 |archive-date = 25 December 2015}}</ref> Git provides features to [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronize]] changes between repositories that share history; for asynchronous collaboration, this extends to repositories on [[Computer network|remote]] machines. Although all repositories (with the same history) are peers, developers often use a central server to host a repository to hold an integrated copy.

Git was originally created by [[Linus Torvalds]] for version control in the development of the [[Linux kernel]].<ref name="pro-git-1.2">{{cite book |url=https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 |title=Pro Git |date=2014 |publisher=Apress |edition=2nd |chapter=A Short History of Git |access-date=26 December 2015 |chapter-url=https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225223054/http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 |archive-date=25 December 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> The trademark "Git" is registered by the [[Software Freedom Conservancy]].

Today, Git is the version control system most commonly used by software developers.
