Arup Consulting Engineers by Sir Ove Arup. Arup had established himself in the 1930s as an expert in reinforced concrete, known for projects such as the Penguin Pool at London Zoo.[10] According to the architectural author Ian Volner, Arup&#x27;s vision when establishing the company came out of a combination of his wartime experiences and a progressive-minde</span><span style="background-color: #649fa5;" title="Chunk 4 | Start: 1800 | End: 2300 | Tokens: 500 (Overlap)">d philosophy broadly aligning with early modernism</span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 5 | Start: 2250 | End: 2750 | Tokens: 500">, was for the organisation to be a force for peace and social betterment in the postwar world.[6] To this end, it would employ professionals of diverse disciplines that could work together to produce projects of greater quality than was achievable by them working in isolation, a concept known as &#x27;Total Design&#x27;.[6][11][12]1970 was a particularly transformative year for the firm; 24 years after foun</span><span style="background-color: #687fa5;" title="Chunk 5 | Start: 2250 | End: 2750 | Tokens: 500 (Overlap)">ding the company, Arup opted to retire from active</span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 6 | Start: 2700 | End: 3200 | Tokens: 500">ly leading the company. At the time, the firm (then Ove Arup &amp; Partners) was made up of several independent practices spread across the globe, so prior to his departure, Arup delivered his &#x27;Key Speech&#x27; on 9 July in Winchester to all his partners from the various practices.[21] The speech set out the aims of the firm and identified the principles of governance by which they might be achieved.
