Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the power of 
large language models with external knowledge retrieval. RAG systems work by first 
retrieving relevant documents from a database, then using those documents as context 
for the language model to generate responses.

Chunking is a critical preprocessing step in RAG systems. The goal of chunking is to 
split large documents into smaller, semantically coherent pieces that can be efficiently 
stored and retrieved. Good chunking strategies ensure that each chunk contains complete 
ideas and relevant context.

There are several chunking strategies available: fixed-size chunking splits text by 
character or token count, recursive chunking splits by paragraphs and sentences, and 
semantic chunking groups text by meaning. The choice of chunking strategy significantly 
impacts retrieval quality.
